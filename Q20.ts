//  Q20
//Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains , rivers, countries, cities, languages or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.
let arraylist=["saudia","palestine","qatar","iraq"];
for(let k=0;k<arraylist.length;k++){ 
console.log(arraylist[k]);
}
